# Google Search technical requirements

 
 
 It costs nothing to get your page in search results, no matter what anyone tries to tell you.
 As long as your page meets the minimum technical requirements, it's eligible to be
 indexed by Google Search:
 

 
 
- Googlebot isn't blocked. 
 
- The page works, meaning that Google receives an HTTP 200 (success) status code. 
 
- The page has indexable content. 
 

 Just because a page meets these requirements doesn't
 mean that a page will be indexed; indexing isn't guaranteed.

 

# Googlebot isn't blocked (it can find and access the page)

 
 Google only indexes pages on the web that are accessible to the public and which don't
 block our crawler, Googlebot ,
 from crawling them. If a page is made private, such as requiring a log-in to view it,
 Googlebot will not crawl it. Similarly, if one of the
 several mechanisms are
 used to block Google from indexing, the page will not be indexed.
 

 

# Check if Googlebot can find and access your page

 
 Pages that are blocked by robots.txt 
 are unlikely to show in Google Search results. To see a list of pages that are inaccessible to
 Google (but that you would like to see in Search results), use both the
 Page Indexing report 
 and Crawl Stats report 
 in Search Console. Each report may contain different information about your URLs, so it's a good idea to look at both reports.
 

 
 To test a specific page, use the URL Inspection tool .
 

 

# The page works (it's not an error page)

 
 Google only indexes pages that are served with an
 HTTP 200 (success) status code .
 Client and server error pages aren't indexed. You can check the HTTP status code for a given
 page with the URL Inspection tool .
 

 

# The page has indexable content

 
 Once Googlebot can find and access a working page, Google checks the page for indexable
 content. Indexable content means:
 

 
 
- The textual content is in a file type that Google Search supports . 
 
- The content doesn't violate our spam policies . 
 

 
 While blocking Googlebot with a robots.txt file will prevent crawling, a page's URL might still appear
 in search results. To instruct Google not to index a page, use
 noindex and allow Google
 to crawl the URL.
